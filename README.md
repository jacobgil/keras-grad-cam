This has been forked from [here](https://github.com/jacobgil/keras-grad-cam), as I faced several errors, that would prevent me from successfully executing the script. I copied the solutions from these two issues together:

## Grad-CAM implementation in Keras ##

Gradient class activation maps are a visualization technique for deep learning networks.

See the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02391v1.pdf

The paper authors torch implementation: https://github.com/ramprs/grad-cam


This code assumes Tensorflow dimension ordering, and uses the VGG16 network in keras.applications by default (the network weights will be downloaded on first use).


Usage: `python grad-cam.py <path_to_image>`
